# SaleSage

This project leverages machine learning to provide accurate sales forecasts and predictions, empowering businesses with data-driven insights.

Built with React for an intuitive front-end and Flask for a robust back-end, the system integrates Long Short-Term Memory [(LSTM)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LSTM.html) networks for future sales forecasting and [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for precise sales predictions.

## 🚀 Introduction
Understanding future sales trends is crucial for strategic decision-making. This project helps businesses make informed choices by analyzing historical sales data and applying advanced ML models to generate accurate forecasts.

## ✨ Key Features
- 📊 **Future Sales Forecasting**: LSTM networks predict upcoming sales trends based on historical data.
- 📈 **Sales Prediction**: XGBoost provides accurate short-term sales predictions.
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React, offering an intuitive and responsive UI.
- 🔗 **RESTful API**: Powered by Flask, handling data processing and model inference efficiently.
